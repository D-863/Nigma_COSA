## (Currently in developement.)
COSA is a C based *Cross Operating System API* in user space made for raw usage and performance yet staying simple, while being free as in both speech and beer(Libre and Gratis, use it with freedom and without charge).

## Overview
The goal with COSA is to give a raw path of control towards the Kernel and *available* Drivers no matter what OS environment it may be on, doing so thru simplistic functions that does not add unnecessary bloat(Every function builds upon each other, even internally).

This allows Applications to complete their purpose without having to worry about the burden and asterisks that comes with every OS, like *How*/*Where* and *What* Drivers/Packages are available..

COSA is ***NOT*** Cross-Platform(For now), it does not Download or Install needed Packages nor is it a OS/Driver on it's own. It can be thought of as a pre-made System where it only compiles used functionality, it only *abstracts* what is already provided from the OS and Drivers inside the user space.

## Note:
COSA is a project I have made *mostly* for myself, it will be the spine for every project I make.
While I am quite intelligent in the subject of programming for my age(If I may say so) I am certainly no expert, just a human Soul that has passion for nerd stuff and insanity. 

(Well- At least I *think* that I have a lot to learn, but maybe my path for new knowledge is short? Who knows. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
