## (Currently in developement.)
COSA is a C based *Cross Operating System API* in user space made for raw usage and performance yet staying simple, while being free as in both speech and beer(Libre and Gratis, use it with freedom and without charge).

## Overview
The goal with COSA is to give a raw path of control towards the Kernel and *available* Drivers no matter what OS environment it may be on, doing so thru simplistic functions that does not add unnecessary bloat(Every function builds upon each other, even internally).

This allows Applications to fulfill their purpose without having to worry about the insanity, hellish burdens and asterisks that comes with every OS, for example: The automation of knowing *What* Systems(Drivers/Packages) are available and *How* to use them, *Where* to do setup's of A->Z for said usage.. And so on.

COSA is ***NOT*** Cross-Platform as that would be the purpose of nCPAA(Cross Platform Architecture API), it does not secretly Download/Install needed Systems on it's own nor is it a OS/Driver on it's own. It can be thought of as a pre-made System where it only compiles used functionality, it only *abstracts* what is already provided from the OS and Systems that's available inside the user space.

## Note:
While nCOSA is a project I have made *mostly* for my projects, practically being the spine for every project I make, I will certainly Design and Document everything for anyone's delight.
While my cognitive's grasp over the subjects of Programming and Computing is wast for my age(If I may say so), I am certainly no expert, just a individual that has passion for nerd stuff and insanity. 

(Well- At least I *hope* that I have a lot to learn, but maybe my path for new knowledge is short? Who knows. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
