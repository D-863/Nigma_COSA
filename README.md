## (Currently in developement.)
nCOSA is a C based *Cross Operating System API* in user space made for raw usage and performance yet staying simple, while being free as in both speech and beer(Libre and Gratis, use it with freedom and without charge).

## Overview
The goal with nCOSA is to give a raw path of control towards the Kernel and *available* Drivers no matter what OS environment it may be on, doing so thru simplistic functions that does not add unnecessary bloat(Every function builds upon each other, even internally).

This allows Applications to fulfill their purpose without having to worry about the insane, hellish burdens and asterisks that comes with every OS, for example: The automation of knowing *What* Systems(Drivers/Packages) are available and *How* to use them, *Where* to do setup's of A->Z for said usage.. And so on.

nCOSA is ***NOT*** Cross-Platform as that would be the purpose of nCAPA(Cross Architecture Platform API), it does not secretly Download/Install needed Systems on it's own nor is it a OS/Driver on it's own. It can be thought of as a self-configuring System that only compiles used functionality that's not fundemental, it only *Abstracts* what is already provided from the OS and Systems that are available inside the user space and, if unable to perform said functionality, requests the user to install the missing System's it requires.

## Note:
While nCOSA is a Module I have *mostly* made as the 'Base' of all my future projects(i.e. nCEngine), I will certainly Design and Document everything for anyone's delight.
While my cognitive's grasp over the subjects of Programming and Computing is wast for my age(If I may say so), I am certainly no expert, just a individual that has passion for nerd stuff and insanity. 

(Well- I at least *Hope* that I have a lot to learn, but maybe my path for new knowledge is short? Who knows, only time will tell. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
